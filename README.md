ArtWorldWarI MediaNight Version 2015
Welcome to ArtWorldWar I!

To start the game in Unity3D (4.6) make sure that you open the LoadingScreen scene and then press Play!

Please use Unity 4.6 to run the game. It will probably run in other Unity versions as well but there might be some other glitches showing up.

Note that this version was changed for an exhibition (MediaNight 2015 at HdM) so it doesn't have the same functionality it would have in a finished state. The game is currently still in development so please be aware that this version doesn't have all desired features implemented yet.

Have fun playing!
